## Features 
The block has an API for managing its state.
-  Blocks are designed to be easily reused in other applications.
-  States:
  -  Normal - the base state in which, by setting the Value, you can control
  the size of an arc that reflects some parameter or the progress of a process. Start
  the arc corresponds to 12 o'clock, the end of the arc when the Value parameter is increased
  moves in a clockwise direction and reaches the start at a value of 100.
  -  Animated – an independent state in which the block or its elements begin to rotate clockwise with a certain period.
  -  Hidden – a state that hides a block from the page.
  -  The application adapts to the screen orientation.
